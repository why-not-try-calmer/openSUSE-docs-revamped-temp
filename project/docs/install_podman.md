## What is Podman

Podman is a a daemonless, open-source tool to manage, deploy and build application containers. Podman is using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and container images, which means that containers crated with/for Docker or CRI-o will work with Podman as well and vice versa. It is coming with a command line interface (CLI) which offers pretty much the same commands like Docker does. How similar are Podman commands to Docker's? Let's put it this way: many Podman users just alias `docker` to `podman`. Like other runtimes, Podman also relies on an OCI compliant container runtime to interface with the operating system. Podamn also has a RESTful API to manage containers, offers automatic updates of containers and has a fantastic `systemd` integration.

## Getting containers running

### Rootfull or rootless

As Podman is daemonless, running containers doesn't require running them with root, but can be started with a user as well. Granted, rootless containers will have no access to networking and can't use privileged ports, but it is a great way to keep the system secure. For instance if an application escapes the container ran as a user it will be able to cause less damage and would have limited access to the system than if it would if it would ran as root. Rootfull containers are recommended for running applications that require access over privileged ports like a public facing `nginx` reverse proxy. Even in that case there could be some rules implemented in the firewall that forwards requests, but that's a different story.

#### Rootless environment configuration 

The next steps will allow for the deployment of a *rootless* configuration with Podman. Important to note that these changes should apply for other distros as well: 
1. **Make sure that `fuse-overlayfs` is installed and it is available in the user `$PATH`.** (In openSUSE `fuse-overlayfs` is a dependency of Podman therefore when Podman is being installed it will install `fuse-overlayfs` as well.) 
``` 
# which fuse-overlayfs  
/usr/bin/fuse-overlayfs 
``` 
2. **Enable user namespaces.** On openSUSE this step should not be necessary. Check the number of available namespaces that are allowed in the system in `/proc/sys/user/max_user_namespaces`. To set a value or a different value you need to run `sysctl user.max_user_namespaces=28633` as **root**. 
3. **/etc/subuid and /etc/subgid configuration.** This is very important so instead of using my own words I move this out from the official Podman documentation and insert it here (source: [rootless tutorial](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/master/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md))    

Rootless Podman requires the user running it to have a range of UIDs listed in /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid files.  The `shadow-utils` or `newuid` package provides these files on different distributions and  they must be installed on the system.  These files will need someone with root privileges on the system to add or update the entries withi
n them.  The following is a summarization from the [How does rootless Podman work?](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/how-does-rootless-podman-work) article by Dan Walsh on [opensource.com](https://opensource.com) 

Update the /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid with fields for each user that will be allowed to create containers that look like the following.  Note that the values for each user must be unique and without any overlap.  If there is an overlap, there is a potential for a user to use another’s namespace and they could corrupt it. 

``` 
cat /etc/subuid 
johndoe:100000:65536 
test:165536:65536 
``` 

The format of this file is USERNAME:UID:RANGE 

* username as listed in /etc/passwd or getpwent. 
* The initial uid allocated for the user. 
* The size of the range of UIDs allocated for the user. 

This means the user johndoe is allocated UIDS 100000-165535 as well as their standard UID in the /etc/passwd file.  NOTE: this is not currently supported with network installs.  These files must be available locally to the host machine.  It is not possible to configure this with LDAP or Active Directory. 

If you update either the /etc/subuid or the /etc/subgid file, you need to stop all the running containers owned by the user and kill the pause process that is running on the system for that user.  This can be done automatically by using the [podman system migrate](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/master/docs/podman-system-migrate.1.md) command which will stop all the containers for the user and will kill the pause process. 

Rather than updating the files directly, the usermod program can be used to assign UIDs and GIDs to a user. 
```
usermod --add-subuids 200000-201000 --add-subgids 200000-201000 johndoe 
grep johndoe /etc/subuid /etc/subgid 
/etc/subuid:johndoe:200000:1001 
/etc/subgid:johndoe:200000:1001 
```

Here I would also add that you need to be careful with the `subuid` and `subgid` allocation as if the same `UID`/`GID` values are given to `users y` as well as for `user x` then `user y` will have access to the containers ran by `user x`.  

### Registries 

Podman supports every OCI compliant registries like Dockerhub, Quay.io, Treescale etc. To check, add, and remove the registries the system uses one can simply edit `/etc/containers/registries.conf`.

```
# For more information on this configuration file, see containers-registries.conf(5).
#
# Registries to search for images that are not fully-qualified.
# i.e. foobar.com/my_image:latest vs my_image:latest
[registries.search]
registries = ["registry.opensuse.org", "docker.io"]

# Registries that do not use TLS when pulling images or uses self-signed
# certificates.
[registries.insecure]
registries = []

# Blocked Registries, blocks the `docker daemon` from pulling from the blocked registry.  If you specify
# "*", then the docker daemon will only be allowed to pull from registries listed above in the search
# registries.  Blocked Registries is deprecated because other container runtimes and tools will not use it.
# It is recommended that you use the trust policy file /etc/containers/policy.json to control which
# registries you want to allow users to pull and push from.  policy.json gives greater flexibility, and
# supports all container runtimes and tools including the docker daemon, cri-o, buildah ...
[registries.block]
registries = []
```
On openSUSE you will have `registry.opensuse.org` added to your registries out of the box which is the official registry of the openSUSE project. You can add for example `quay.io` to this list to be able to search, pull, and push from/to Quay. When searching or pulling a container from a registry, `Podman` will check the registries from `/etc/containers/registries.conf` listed under `[registries.search]` block. `Podman` will check the URI in the order they're added in `[registries.search]`.

#### Login to registry

Just like with Docker you can log in to a registry with your username and password using `podman login [registry]`. Once logged in the credentials will be stored in `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json`. For the sake of automation you could make a copy of this `auth.json` file to be used in different scripts for building or deploying containerized applications, but keep the file with your credentials safe.

### Searching for a container

To search with Podman for an application use:
```
$ podman search nginx

### Starting a container

Starting a container that runs in the background and exposing port 8000 to be accessible from the outside:
```
$ podman run -d -p 8000:8000 nginx                                                                                                      
41e3829d1c800d40feb9d88ac962d29c8256b60ec5747f732717893d93b0f35e
```
To list running containers:
```
[~] podman ps                                                                                                                                              
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                           COMMAND               CREATED        STATUS            PORTS                   NAMES
41e3829d1c80  docker.io/library/nginx:latest  nginx -g daemon o...  3 seconds ago  Up 3 seconds ago  0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp  suspicious_feistel
```
This list provides a lot of information about running containers. 
To list every container, running or not:
```
$ podman ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                           COMMAND               CREATED         STATUS                      PORTS                   NAMES

41e3829d1c80  docker.io/library/nginx:latest  nginx -g daemon o...  18 minutes ago  Up 18 minutes ago           0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp  suspicious_feistel
bc5030bffd6c  docker.io/library/nginx:latest  nginx -g daemon o...  18 minutes ago  Created                     0.0.0.0:80->8000/tcp    jolly_johnson
```
If needed the output format of `podman ps` can be manipulated with the `--format` flag. For example to list only the container ID and the image name:
```
[~] podman ps --format "{{.ID}} {{.Image}}"                                                                                                                           
41e3829d1c80 docker.io/library/nginx:latest
```
This pretty print containers to JSON. The following placeholders are available:
* .ID: Container ID                             
* .Image:Image Name/ID
* .ImageID: Image ID
* .Command: Quoted command used                      
* .CreatedAt: Creation time for container              
* .RunningFor: Time elapsed since container was started 
* .Status: Status of container
* .Pod: Pod the container is associated with     
* .Ports: Exposed ports                            
* .Size: Size of container
* .Names: Name of container                        
* .Labels: All the labels assigned to the container
* .Mounts: Volumes mounted in the container            
For more visit the `podman ps` man page.

#### Deleting containers and images
Running containers or images that are being used can't be deleted unless it is forced. The best course of action is to stop the container then delete it, and then delete the image.
```
[~] podman ps #List running containers

#### Managing images

To list all available images use `podman images`. This will provide a list of every image that is currently available in the system and ready to be used without needing to pull it from a registry. To delete an image use `podman rmi`. Visit the `podman images` man page for more.

### Podman Pods

The `pod` concept has been introduced in Kuberentes and Docker users usually don't even think of the possibility or benefits to run pods in a local runtime or a development environment. Pods are great if for example you need a database (db) container that you don't want to bind to a routable network. In comes the idea of the `pod`. Instead of binding the db to a routable network you can bind it to `localhost` therefore other containers within the pod can connect to it using `localhost` as they share the network name space. Another use case can be to group containers in pods. 
Every pod has an 'infra' container that functions as the namespace holder, stores data on port bindings, cgroup-parent values, and kernel namespaces are all assigned to the “infra” container. Once the pod is created these values can not be changed. The pod can also allow to start, stop, pause multiple containers at once just by doing the same as would with a single container, but instead by container the commands can be executed by pods resulting of a desired effect, but faster and a lot more comfortably.   
For details on pod related cli commands visit the `podman pod` man page. 

#### Pod creation

You can create the pods by naming them and exposing the required ports. This way we're not required to setup containers individually in terms of publishing ports just adding the containers to them.   
```
$ podman pod create -n yaltb -p 8000:8000                                                                        
7244e77552d9bee402383a37906813b4194cef89c930c87d4d590d92fce827b0
$ podman pod list                                                                            
POD ID        NAME    STATUS   CREATED        INFRA ID      # OF CONTAINERS
7244e77552d9  yaltb   Created  8 seconds ago  4a696258e500  1
```
A little breakdown here:
* `-n` or `--name` will allow to set the name of the pod.
* `-p` or `--publish` will expose the desired port(s) that will be used to access container(s) from outside the host.
* `podman pod list` is listing the available pods with their basic information.
For more information visit the `podman pod create` man page.

#### Adding containers to a pod

Pods can hold as many containers as you want. To add containers just set the `--pod` flag when creating the container.
```
$ podman run -d --pod yaltb nginx                                                                                                                                         
6645234da2d18f60632fdcfed3a7825a81649c606dfeba70fec11b9d5479174d
$ podman pod list

7244e77552d9  yaltb   Running  10 minutes ago  4a696258e500  2
$ podman ps -a --pod                                                                                                                                                      
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                 COMMAND          CREATED         STATUS             PORTS                   NAMES               POD ID        PODNAME
6645234da2d1  nginx                 /usr/sbin/nginx  15 seconds ago  Up 15 seconds ago  0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp  clever_williamson   7244e77552d9  yaltb

```
Breaking it down:
* `podman run -d --pod yaltb nginx` will create and add an `nginx` container to the previously create `yaltb` pod. The pod has been defined by the `--pod` flag followed by the name of the pod. Notice that we didn't expose ports as they are already exposed in the created port. **Important:** network can't be configured when it is shared with a pod therefore you need to expose/publish ports upon pod creation.
* `podman ps -a --pod` will list every container that is running in pods.

#### Managing containers in pods

Containers in pods can be managed individually regardless they're running within a pod. Do check above for the options for managing containers. This means that if you need to remove a container from a pod 

#### Exporting pods

Pods can be exported with `podman generate` command. This would allow one to take the exported pod and deploy it the same way it is deployed on the local runtime on a different Podman server or even on a Kubernetes cluster.
```
$ podman generate kube yaltb

```
Lets break down the above:
* `podman generate kube yaltb` will generated a `YAML` file which one can take to another server and `play` it providing the same exact pod that it is running on the local runtime.
* `podman pod stop yaltb` will stop the `yaltb` pod and all the containers in it.
* `podman pod rm yaltb` will delete the `yaltb` pod.
* `podman play kube yaltb_pod.yml` will start the exported pods based on the `YAML` file. The pod and the containers in the pod listed in the following commands.

### Podman and systemd

Podman has a fantastic integration with `systemd`. I believe at this point the users are even able to run `systemd` **within** a container which makes perfect sense. Why would we have to use anything different inside a container than we already got used to outside of a container. Anyhow we not covering this, but managing containers with `systemd`. 
As we deploy more and more containers managing them using the Podman cli tool only may quickly become burdensome. It is much easier to manage the pods and containers with `systemd` for example to restart, stop, or to start them. Using `systemd` will also enable us to utilize `podman auto-update` for updating the containers.

#### Generating a systemd unit

Podman has the ability to generate the unit files for us which is probably a relief as it makes life incredibly comfortable. Criteria is that it outputs the generated units into a file using the container's name or ID. In this example I will go for the ID which I will cover why in the `Podman auto-update` section.
```
$ podman generate systemd --files --new admiring_franklin

```
Breaking all that down:
* `podman generate systemd` which will generate `systemd` units
* ` --files` which will output the generated unit to a file as `container-[$CONTAINERNAME]
* ` --new admiring_franklin` will allow `systemd` to create and run updated images followed by the container's name.

This unit file can be added to `systemd`, enabled and pretty much it. Podman and systemd will take care of everything following like starting the container on boot and updating it. When running a rootless Podman session:
```
$ mv container-aaef566e500973a2d4e9df22208e4a74ae5ea961083adbbe6bb6e98fbb19f7e7.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
$ systemctl --user enable --now container-aaef566e500973a2d4e9df22208e4a74ae5ea961083adbbe6bb6e98fbb19f7e7.service
```

### Podman inspect and logs

To reveal the parameters a container or a pod has been created with we can use the `podman inspect` command followed by the name/id of the container or pod.
```
$ podman inspect admiring_franklin

`Podman inspect` literally covers everything that container is running with. Labels, mounts, volumes, exposed ports etc. Extremely useful for debugging and of course the output can be filtered. For more visit the `podman inspect` man page.

The next useful tool to check what is happening real-time inside a container is `podman logs` which will output the `stdout` of the container. This can cover errors, warnings or general output information from the application inside the container.
```

``` 
This can output a lot of information and it is rolling with the container's life cycle. To monitor the logs real-time as they come in - such as one would do with `tail -f` - you can do that with `podman logs -f` followed by the container's name or ID.
 
### Persistent data

Containers are not able to store persistent data. If you need an application to store data between restarts and updates you need to either attach a `volume` or `mount` storage space outside of the container from the host system.

#### Mounts

Are basically can be anything, a file, a folder stored anywhere on the host system. This is not a storage space that is managed by Podman and can be accessed from the host system and from within the container as well. Creating a container with bind mount:

```
$ podman run -it --name tw --mount type=bind,source=./binder,target=/mnt opensuse/tumbleweed /bin/bash

```
Breaking it down:
* `podman run -it --name tw` will start a container in interactive mode and open a terminal (tty) inside the container which is named `tw`,
* `--mount type=bind,source=./binder,target=/mnt` the `--mount` flag will tell Podman that we want to mount something from the host file system, the type is set to `bind` then with `source` set the path to the folder and with `target` set the path within the container where to mount it,
* `opensuse/tumbleweed /bin/bash` defining the image - in this case openSUSE Tumbleweed - and what to run which will be the `bash` shell,
* Following that is a little proof-of-concept that the created file from within the container stay on the host file system after exiting.

#### Volumes

Volumes, unlike bind mounts are managed by Podman and this is the preferred way of having a persistent storage space attached to a container. If running a rootfull session the volume will be stored under `/var/lib/containers`, while rootless volumes will be stored under `~/.local/share/containers/storage`. To be able to attach volumes first need to create them with `podman volume create` and volumes can be listed with `podman volume list`. The volumes can be named and can have labels for meta information. 
```
$ podman volume create testvol                                                                                               
testvol
$ podman volume list

```
Now mounting the created volume inside a container:
```
$ podman run -it --name tw --mount type=volume,source=testvol,target=/mnt opensuse/tumbleweed /bin/bash

Breaking it down (the command is almost identical to the one used in `bind mount` so to keep it short will focus only the differences):
* `--mount type=volume,source=testvol,target=/mnt` just like with `bind mounts` need to use the `--mount` flag, but the `type` will be `volume` and the `source` does not need the whole path just the name/id of the `volume`. Upon the creation of the volume if a name is not set a random one will be generated
* This is being followed by a proof-of-concept in which I created a container, mounted the volume, wrote a file and stored it in the volume then destroyed the container. Recreated it with the same command and `volume` and read out the files previously created inside the already destroyed container.
For more visit the `podman volume` man page.

### Updating containers

Can go about this a few different ways like pulling a container, launching it, mounting the necessary shares and config files and starting it on a different exposed port than the one we're planning to "update". Once this is done, tested and works fine can just change the route to point to this updated container. Me being a lazy DevOps engineer I don't like this option so let's visit `podman auto-update`.

#### Podman auto-update

Before we go any further there are few things to make sure are set correctly on our container:
* there is no `--restart=always` flag present,
* the container is managed by `systemd`,
* the `systemd` unit has been generated by the container's ID not by it's name,
* the `systemd` unit has been generated with the `--new` flag.

Podman's other important feature is the automatic updates of containers without the need of even putting containers in pods or adding a Watchtower service. This is done by adding the `--label io.containers.autoupdate=image` label during container creation.    
This to be followed by generating `systemd` units for the container: `podman generate systemd --new --files [container ID or name]`. Once this is ready and the unit file is under the corresponding `systemd` folder - depending on how podman is used, rootfull or rootless - the container unit to be started. Following this the `podman auto-update` command can update every container with changed images.

I strongly suggest checking out the man pages of podman which provides a lot of information straight from the terminal. Also the following articles will help a lot on your `podman` journey:
