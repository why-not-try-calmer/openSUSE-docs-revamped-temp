# Choosing a distribution
## openSUSE distributions
If you are a desktop user, openSUSE offers the choice between two Linux distributions designed to meet your needs:

* [Tumbleweed](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/tumbleweed)
* [Leap](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/leap)

### Tumbleweed
Tumbleweed is a _rolling-release_ distribution: instead of having fixed points where you will be offered to perform a system upgrade (think of Windows, Ubuntu, or macOS, where each numbered version leads to the next), you will be frequently offered to upgrade multiple components of your system.

??? info
    Those components are called _packages_, because they "pack" the programs and resources making up most of your system, along with tools to install them). "Upgrading" means "Upgrading packages" (such as those that constitute your Linux distribution).

Even though Tumbleweed uses a rolling-release model, it is very stable: openSUSE thoroughly tests every package before going into an update, ensuring the stability of your system. Moreover you can always revert back to the previous state of Tumbleweed (in jargon: "switch to the previous snapshot". Snapshots are explained [here](snapper.md)).

What you have to bear in mind, however, is that Tumbleweed requires a reliable internet connection and a healthy hard drive to work as designed. It also requires that you sometimes take interest in the updating process.

### Leap
Leap is a more traditional distribution: it uses a fixed-points release model, just like Windows, Ubuntu, or macOS. Leap is a very battle-hardened operating system, mostly made up of packages brought over from SUSE Linux Enterprise, a commercial Linux operating system for servers, and of packages from Tumbleweed after they were tested, tried and used by the community.

It is worth noting that Leap provides a Linux kernel that is several years behind the version offered by Tumbleweed. 

??? info
    The kernel is the heart of any Linux operating system. It translates your keystrokes and mouse clicks into the ones and zeros the computer understands, and is updated regularly so that the computer can respond to new hardware added to the system." 
.
    
This means that you might be better served by Tumbleweed if you have a recent computer or rely extensively on "exotic" hardware.

### Our recommendation
Pick Tumbleweed if you intend to use your machine as a desktop machine unless:

* You have a very limited bandwidth or an unreliable access to the Internet.
* You have an old (7+ years old mechanical hard drive that will struggle with frequent, numerous updates.
* You cannot afford to reboot your computer frequently to install updates.
* You don't want to use, or switch between, different snapshots.
* Your rely on specific versions of important packages, including hardware drivers, and generally speaking you don't want or cannot take advantage of recent packages, including recent kernels.
* You would rather not do package management manually and more generally, you would rather avoid using the command line.

The more conditions apply to your use case, the stronger we recommend you to install Leap instead of Tumbleweed.

??? info
    It is not recommended for new users, however, it is possible to use microOS on a desktop computer, taking advantage of transactional updates. This might appeal to advanced users who want to provide friends or relatives with an operating system that will require little to no maintenance. You might be interested in [our microOS documentation](microos_getting_started.md) for more about this use case.

## Desktop Environments
Leap offers the __GNOME__ and __KDE Plasma__ desktop environments by default. Tumbleweed offers __GNOME__, __KDE Plasma__, and __XFCE__. These options are chosen during the __System Role__ section of the installation. Additional options are available in the __Software__ selection of the installer. These desktop environment patterns may also be viewed and modified with the [YaST](/yast/) __Software Management__ module.

Modern desktop environments have evolved into highly consistent and productive computing experiences. Choosing the right desktop environment for you can be a deeply personal experience; many people feel as passionately about their desktop environment as they do their distribution. 

One of the distinguishing options of openSUSE, during the installation, is the ability to choose a desktop environment. This provides a certain level of assurance that you will have a well-supported desktop experience for that desktop environment, no derivatives or spin-offs needed.

## Installation

During __openSUSE Installation__, there is a section titled __System Role__, which applies patterns to the software selected for the respective installation. This is the primary means to select a desktop environment. There is an additional option titled __Generic Desktop__. If you wish to install a desktop environment available in the installer, but not in the __System Role__, you can select __Generic Desktop__ and customize the Software selection later within the installer.

The descriptions below are as provided by the respective projects.

### GNOME
> GNOME 3 has been designed from the ground up to help you have the best possible computing experience.
>
> GNOME 3 provides a focused working environment that helps you to get things done, and it is packed with features that will make you more productive. A powerful search feature lets you access all your work from one place. Side-by-side windows makes it easy to view several documents at the same time, and we even provide a way to turn off notifications when you really need to concentrate on the task in hand.

??? info "Install Gnome"
    __Installer__ &gt; __System Role__: Select __Desktop with GNOME__

### KDE Plasma
> Plasma is made to stay out of the way as it helps you get things done. But under its light and intuitive surface, it's a powerhouse. So you're free to choose ways of usage right as you need them and when you need them.
>
> With Plasma the user is king. Not happy with the color scheme? Change it! Want to have your panel on the left edge of the screen? Move it! Don't like the font? Use a different one! Download custom widgets in one click and add them to your desktop or panel.
>
> [KDE.org](https://kde.org)

??? info "Install KDE Plasma"
    __Installer__ &gt; __System Role__: Select __Desktop with KDE Plasma__

### XFCE
> XFCE is a lightweight desktop environment for UNIX-like operating systems. It aims to be fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly.
>
> XFCE embodies the traditional UNIX philosophy of modularity and re-usability. It consists of a number of components that provide the full functionality one can expect of a modern desktop environment. They are packaged separately and you can pick among the available packages to create the optimal personal working environment.
>
> Another priority of XFCE is adherence to standards, specifically those defined at [freedesktop.org](https://www.freedesktop.org).

        Clicking the __Details...__ button on __Installer__ &gt; __Software Selection and System Tasks__ displays packages associated with the respective patterns. 

### Generic Desktop
Another option for a __System Role__ is the __Generic Desktop__ environment. This option enables __IceWM__, but also allows selection of one of the optional desktop environments later, during the __Software__ selection of the installation. If you intend to choose one of the other desktop environments, choose __Yes__, when asked "Activate online repositories now?" and ensure __Main Repository (OSS)__ is enabled on the __Online Repositories__ step.

#### IceWM
> IceWM is a window manager for the X Window System. The goal of IceWM is speed, simplicity, and not getting in the user’s way. It comes with a taskbar with pager, global and per-window keybindings and a dynamic menu system. Application windows can be managed by the keyboard and mouse. Windows can be iconified to the taskbar, to the tray, to the desktop or be hidden. They are controllable by a quick switch window (Alt+Tab) and in a window list.

### Additional Choices
Before confirming the installation, an overview is provided with the selected installation options, titled __Installer Settings__. At this point, you can modify the __Software__ selected to be installed. In addition to reducing or adding packages, you can also select other desktop environments to install.

If you prefer one of these desktop environments, de-select the __A very basic desktop__ pattern, then select one of the below patterns:
#### Enlightenment
> Enlightenment is classified as a "desktop shell" as it provides everything you need to operate your desktop or laptop, but it is not a full application suite. This covers functionality including launching applications, managing their windows and performing system tasks like suspending, rebooting, managing files and so on.

#### LXDE
> LXDE, which stands for Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment, is a desktop environment which is lightweight and fast. It is designed to be user friendly and slim, while keeping the resource usage low. LXDE uses less RAM and less CPU while being a feature rich desktop environment. Unlike other tightly integrated desktops LXDE strives to be modular, so each component can be used independently with few dependencies. This makes porting LXDE to different distributions and platforms easier.
